/*
    BlueprintAlignment's "Grid position" field, added after a real screenshot
    from the game showed two X/Y pairs where the editor only ever had one -
    "Grid position" above the Absolute/Relative choice, and a second pair
    beside "Absolute" itself. Round-tripping real blueprint strings through
    the game at each step (not reasoning about it) settled what each one
    actually is, and it took two rounds to get right:

        "Grid position" writes NO blueprint field of its own, and there is no
        LuaItemStack property that sets it directly either - the game's own
        oracle probe for this (`probe-blueprint-grid-position.mjs`) set
        `blueprint_position_relative_to_grid` instead, which is "Absolute"'s
        own X/Y, a different field a row below. That probe's conclusion (grid
        position leaves entities alone) is correct for the field it actually
        touched and does not transfer.

        Decoding real exports settled the actual field: it displays
        `-floor(minX), -floor(minY)` over every entity's raw position (see
        `Blueprint.getGridPositionDisplay()`'s own doc comment for the
        formula and how it was measured), and typing a target into it in the
        real game genuinely moves every entity so that formula, applied
        afterwards, reads back exactly what was typed. So the first
        implementation here (#222 review) - `Blueprint.translateEntities`,
        moving every `Entity.position` by the negated typed amount - had the
        right idea for what the game does, but could not work in *this*
        codebase for an unrelated reason this spec is shaped to guard
        against: `Blueprint.serialize()` re-centres every exported position
        on `getCenter()`'s bounding box of the *current* entities, recomputed
        on every call. Translating every entity by (dx, dy) moves that box's
        centre by exactly (dx, dy) too, so subtracting the shifted centre
        from the shifted positions always reproduces the pre-translation
        numbers - the shift is invisible to the exported string by
        construction, for any implementation built on moving entities.
        Nothing in the first version of this file could have caught that:
        every assertion read `entityPosition()`, the live model, which
        genuinely did change - the exported string, which did not, was never
        checked.

    The fix stores the *offset needed to reach the typed target* separately
    (`Blueprint.gridPositionOffset`, see its own doc comment) and applies it
    only inside `serialize()`, against the already-computed centre - after
    the recentring, not before it, which a recentre cannot undo. Live entity
    positions - and so `PositionGrid`, rendering, and every other model-level
    read - never move at all. So every test below checks the *exported*
    positions (via `encodeLoaded` + `decodeBlueprintString`), and the first
    one explicitly pins that the live model does NOT move, which is the
    regression guard against reintroducing a translate-based approach in
    this codebase specifically - not a claim that the real game avoids
    moving entities, which it does not.

    BlueprintAlignment's own coordinates - packages/editor/src/UI/
    BlueprintAlignment.ts, imported directly rather than copied, so a layout
    change there cannot silently desync what this file clicks - since there
    is no test hook for a control buried this deep in a dialog, the same
    shape tests/chest-editor.spec.ts uses for ChestEditor's filter grid.

        position reads - but `Blueprint` emitted `'create-tile'` and nothing
