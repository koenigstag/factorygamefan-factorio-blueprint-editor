        Per recipe, what each reader of its ingredient and result lists answers,
        or "THREW" where it did not answer at all.

        The two fields hold three runtime shapes - a list, `{}`, or nothing - and
        the readers disagree about which they handle: OverlayContainer defends
        against the missing one, Entity's accessors against the missing one, and
        EntityInfoPanel against neither. `{}` defeats all three, since it is
        neither undefined nor iterable.

        Keyed by recipe rather than by entity because that is what varies here; the
        machine is the same one throughout. This walks every recipe in FD, not just
        the ones the test blueprints use, which is the point - the shapes that
        break are on recipes no real base contains.

        Takes the blueprint to walk rather than reading the loaded one, and for the
        same reason spriteDataTally does plus a sharper one: loading this blueprint
        renders it, EntitySprite.getDrawData asks every crafting machine for
        assemblerHasFluidInputs, and on the `{}` recipes that throws inside
        EntityContainer's constructor and takes the whole load down. Decoding
        without rendering is the only way to reach the readers one at a time.
