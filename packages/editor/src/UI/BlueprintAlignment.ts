 * has that carries no field of its own in the blueprint string - see "Grid
 * position" below, and `Blueprint.gridPositionOffsetStore`'s own doc comment
 * for the export-time mechanism backing it.
 *
 * Every text field here commits on `'blur'`, not `'changed'` - `'changed'`
 * fires on every keystroke (the DOM `'input'` event), and every commit here
 * re-renders from the blueprint afterwards (`refreshFromBlueprint`), which
 * overwrites the DOM input's own in-progress text with whatever that
 * keystroke alone parsed to. For Grid position specifically that meant the
 * field wiping itself back to its last committed value after the first
 * character typed; for Absolute X/Y it meant a leading '-' parsing to 0 and
 * being immediately echoed back, so a negative value could never be typed at
 * all - same mechanism, two different symptoms. Blur waits for the edit to
 * actually finish before either effect can happen.
 *
 * `absoluteSnapping`/`positionRelativeToGrid` are only meaningful while
 * `snapToGrid` is set - their inputs disable together with Grid size's while
 * it's off, rather than silently accepting edits the game would ignore.
 * Absolute's X/Y additionally disable whenever Relative is chosen instead:
 * measured against the game (issue #226), Absolute is the mode that
 * actually carries a position through export - `Blueprint.serialize` drops
 * it under Relative regardless of what's typed here, so the field disables
 * there rather than silently discarding it.
